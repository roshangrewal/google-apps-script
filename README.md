### About Apps Script
Google Apps Script is a rapid application development platform that makes it fast and easy to create business applications that integrate with G Suite. We can write code in modern JavaScript and have access to built-in libraries for favorite G Suite applications like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and more. There's nothing to installâ€”they give us a code editor right in our browser, and scripts run on Google's servers.
